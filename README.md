A Chrome extension to reuse google docs form options, so I can
remember what I ordered for lunch last week.

Adds a 'Fill with Saved Selections' button to the top of the form
and a 'Save Selections' button to the bottom of the form.

Saves form options to localStorage using the form title as the key, so
it won't work if the form title changes or you try to load the data on a
different computer than you saved it.
